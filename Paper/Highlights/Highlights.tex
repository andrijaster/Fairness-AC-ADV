	HIGHLIGHTS:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  A novel method for mitigating bias in discriminative dataset by using an adversarial framework to learn an instance reweighing function is proposed
		\item  FAIR comes in four variants differing in the weighting method
		\item FAIR is evaluated on four different real-world datasets and compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.
		\item The method can provide interpretable information about fairness of individual instances
	\end{itemize}
